Description
-----------

Nodepool is a system for launching single-use test nodes on demand based on
images built with cached data. It is designed to work with any OpenStack based
cloud, and is part of a suite of tools that form a comprehensive test system
including Jenkins and Zuul.

Requirements
------------

* pip3 to be installed if using nodepool_install_method: (git|pip)
* docker to be installed if using nodepool_install_method: docker
  *NOTE*
  Docker support should be consider experimental. You will need to create
  systemd service files manually. There are too many possible settings
  for docker, which make is almost impossible to support via Ansible.
